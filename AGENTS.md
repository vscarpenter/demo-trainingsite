# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- Root entry: `index.html`; app bootstraps at `src/main.tsx` and `src/App.tsx`.
- UI components: `src/components/**` (PascalCase files, colocated props/types).
- Styles: `src/styles/globals.css` (TailwindCSS).
- Types & utilities: `src/types/**`, `src/lib/**`.
- Static assets and course HTML/media: `public/**`.
- Build output: `dist/` (generated by Vite; do not commit).
- Deployment script: `deploy.sh` (S3 static website sync & setup).

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- Install: `npm install`
- Dev server: `npm run dev` (or `./start.sh`) — starts Vite with HMR.
- Build: `npm run build` — TypeScript check then production build to `dist/`.
- Preview: `npm run preview` — serve the built site locally.
- Lint: `npm run lint` — run ESLint over `ts/tsx`.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Language: TypeScript + React 18; functional components and hooks.
- Indentation: 2 spaces; semicolons; single quotes for strings.
- Components: PascalCase filenames (e.g., `ContentViewer.tsx`).
- Variables/functions: `camelCase`; types/interfaces: `PascalCase`.
- Styling: Tailwind utility classes; keep classes readable and grouped by layout→color→state.

## Testing Guidelines
- No test harness is set up yet. If adding logic, prefer Vitest + React Testing Library.
- Suggested naming: colocate `*.test.ts(x)` next to the unit under test.
- Keep tests deterministic; avoid network/filesystem I/O in unit tests.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Use clear, imperative commit messages (e.g., "Add sidebar progress bar").
- Conventional Commits are encouraged: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`.
- PRs should include: concise description, before/after context or screenshots, and any related issue links.
- Keep changes focused; avoid unrelated refactors.

## Deployment
- Build then deploy to S3: `npm run build && ./deploy.sh`.
- `deploy.sh` sets up static website hosting and syncs `dist/` to `s3://sunit-training/`.
- Website endpoint pattern: `http://<bucket>.s3-website-<region>.amazonaws.com`.

## Security & Configuration Tips
- Do not commit secrets. AWS credentials should be managed via the AWS CLI/SDK config on your machine.
- Large media belongs in `public/`; prefer relative paths that Vite copies through.
